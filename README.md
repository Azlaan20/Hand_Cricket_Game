  <em>A classic hand cricket game with an advanced AI twist!</em>
</p>

---

## üí° Overview

Welcome to the world of Hand Cricket! üåü This is a thrilling command-line-based cricket game where you face off against an advanced AI opponent. The goal? Outscore your digital adversary or dismiss the AI batsman with your cunning bowling skills. Are you up for the challenge? üèÜ

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Run the `play_game()` function from the Python script.
2. Use your cricketing instincts to choose a number of fingers (1 to 6) while batting or bowling.
3. Swing for the fences while batting and aim to accumulate as many runs as you can.
4. When bowling, strategically match the AI batsman's choice of fingers to claim a wicket.

## üìú Rules

- When batting, be careful! If your choice of fingers matches the AI's, you're caught out!
- Runs scored while batting are tallied to your total score.
- The game proceeds for a specified number of thrilling overs.
- The player with the highest cumulative score at the end of the game emerges victorious!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x

## üöÄ Usage

1. üì• Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. üèè Fire up your terminal and run the `hand_cricket.py` script using Python.
